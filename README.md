In this folder are three files:
(1) Readme
(2) CSV: "2014testdata": this is a file of voter data from a 2014 election in two cities. Variables of interest for this research include: "Total Pop" - the total population in each voting precinct. "%HL" - the percent of the population in each precinct that is Hispanic/Latino. "PERCENT WIN NORMALIZED" - the percent of votes from that precinct that were cast for candidates who won the election, normalized by the the percent of votes from the entire city that were cast for candidates who won the election.
(3) Jupyter notebook "2019_8_12_VoterDataWeightedCorrelation" - this file includes code to calculate the correlation between "%HL" and "PERCENTWINNORMALIZED" weighted by the population in each precinct.
